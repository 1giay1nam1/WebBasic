    <h2 id="meet-laravel">Meet Laravel</h2>
    <p>Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. A web framework provides a structure and starting point for creating your application, allowing you to focus on creating something amazing while we sweat the details.</p>

    <p>Laravel strives to provide an amazing developer experience while providing powerful features such as thorough dependency injection, an expressive database abstraction layer, queues and scheduled jobs, unit and integration testing, and more.</p>
        
     <p>Whether you are new to PHP web frameworks or have years of experience, Laravel is a framework that can grow with you. We'll help you take your first steps as a web developer or give you a boost as you take your expertise to the next level. We can't wait to see what you build.</p>
    <h3 id="why-laravel">Why Laravel?</h3>
    <p>There are a variety of tools and frameworks available to you when building a web application. However, we believe Laravel is the best choice for building modern, full-stack web applications</p>
    <h4>A Progressive Framework</h4>
    <p>We like to call Laravel a "progressive" framework. By that, we mean that Laravel grows with you. If you're just taking your first steps into web development, Laravel's vast library of documentation, guides, and video tutorials will help you learn the ropes without becoming overwhelmed.</p>
    <h4>A Scalable Framework</h4>
    <p>Laravel is incredibly scalable. Thanks to the scaling-friendly nature of PHP and Laravel's built-in support for fast, distributed cache systems like Redis, horizontal scaling with Laravel is a breeze. In fact, Laravel applications have been easily scaled to handle hundreds of millions of requests per month.</p>
    <h4>A Community Framework</h4>
    <p>Laravel combines the best packages in the PHP ecosystem to offer the most robust and developer friendly framework available. In addition, thousands of talented developers from around the world have contributed to the framework. Who knows, maybe you'll even become a Laravel contributor.</p>
    <h2 id="your-fist-laravel-project">Your First Laravel Project</h2>
    <p>Before creating your first Laravel project, you should ensure that your local machine has PHP and Composer installed. If you are developing on macOS, PHP and Composer can be installed via Homebrew. In addition, we recommend installing Node and NPM.</p>
    <p>After you have installed PHP and Composer, you may create a new Laravel project via the Composer create-project command:</p>

    <h2 id="your-fist-laravel-project">Laravel & Docker</h2>
    <p>We want it to be as easy as possible to get started with Laravel regardless of your preferred operating system. So, there are a variety of options for developing and running a Laravel project on your local machine. While you may wish to explore these options at a later time, Laravel provides Sail, a built-in solution for running your Laravel project using Docker.</p>
    <p>Docker is a tool for running applications and services in small, light-weight "containers" which do not interfere with your local machine's installed software or configuration. This means you don't have to worry about configuring or setting up complicated development tools such as web servers and databases on your local machine. To get started, you only need to install Docker Desktop.</p>
    <p>Laravel Sail is a light-weight command-line interface for interacting with Laravel's default Docker configuration. Sail provides a great starting point for building a Laravel application using PHP, MySQL, and Redis without requiring prior Docker experience.</p>
    <h3 id="macos">Getting Started On macOS</h3>
    <p>If you're developing on a Mac and Docker Desktop is already installed, you can use a simple terminal command to create a new Laravel project. For example, to create a new Laravel application in a directory named "example-app", you may run the following command in your terminal:</p>
    <p>Of course, you can change "example-app" in this URL to anything you like - just make sure the application name only contains alpha-numeric characters, dashes, and underscores. The Laravel application's directory will be created within the directory you execute the command from.</p>
    <h3 id="windows">Getting Started On Windows</h3>
    <p>Before we create a new Laravel application on your Windows machine, make sure to install Docker Desktop. Next, you should ensure that Windows Subsystem for Linux 2 (WSL2) is installed and enabled. WSL allows you to run Linux binary executables natively on Windows 10. Information on how to install and enable WSL2 can be found within Microsoft's developer environment documentation.</p>
    <p>Next, you are ready to create your first Laravel project. Launch Windows Terminal and begin a new terminal session for your WSL2 Linux operating system. Next, you can use a simple terminal command to create a new Laravel project. For example, to create a new Laravel application in a directory named "example-app", you may run the following command in your terminal:</p>
    <img width="50%" src="https://files.fullstack.edu.vn/f8-prod/public-images/644f4a8003083.png " >
    <h3 id="linux">Getting Started On Linux</h3>
    <p>If you're developing on Linux and Docker Compose is already installed, you can use a simple terminal command to create a new Laravel project. For example, to create a new Laravel application in a directory named "example-app", you may run the following command in your terminal:</p>
    <p>Of course, you can change "example-app" in this URL to anything you like - just make sure the application name only contains alpha-numeric characters, dashes, and underscores. The Laravel application's directory will be created within the directory you execute the command from.</p>
    <h3 id="sail-services">Choosing Your Sail Services</h3>
    <p>When creating a new Laravel application via Sail, you may use the with query string variable to choose which services should be configured in your new application's docker-compose.yml file. Available services include mysql, pgsql, mariadb, redis, memcached, meilisearch, minio, selenium, and mailpit:</p>
    <p>If you do not specify which services you would like configured, a default stack of mysql, redis, meilisearch, mailpit, and selenium will be configured.

        You may instruct Sail to install a default Devcontainer by adding the devcontainer parameter to the URL:</p>
